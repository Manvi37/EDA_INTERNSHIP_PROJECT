This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about used cars. The dataset includes various attributes such as car name, location, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, owner type, mileage, engine specifications, power, seats, new price, and price. The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into the distribution of car prices, explore the relationship between mileage and price, visualize the counts of different fuel types, and examine the correlation between various features.

Functionalities:

Data Loading: The project begins by loading the dataset from a CSV file using the Pandas library.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Summary statistics of the dataset are displayed to understand its structure.
Data types of columns are checked to ensure consistency.
Unnecessary columns such as 'New_Price' are dropped, and some columns are renamed for clarity.
Missing values are checked and rows with missing values are dropped from the dataset.

Data Visualization:
Distribution of Price: A histogram is plotted to visualize the distribution of car prices.
Relationship between Mileage and Price: A scatter plot is created to explore the relationship between mileage and price, with points colored by owner type.
Counts of Different Fuel Types: A count plot is generated to display the distribution of cars by fuel type.
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap is plotted to visualize the correlation between different features of the dataset.

Output Generated:
Histogram: Distribution of Car Prices
Scatter Plot: Mileage vs. Price (Colored by Owner Type)
Count Plot: Count of Cars by Fuel Type
Heatmap: Correlation Matrix

Dependencies:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn: For data visualization.
Matplotlib: For additional data visualization capabilities.
Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into the characteristics of used cars based on the provided dataset. It demonstrates various data preprocessing techniques, visualization methods, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) approaches to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. The generated visualizations and analysis outputs can be utilized for making informed decisions in the domain of used car sales and marketing.
